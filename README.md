### About

The Airplane Booking System database is designed to manage and maintain booking details for an airline. This centralized database ensures data retrieval efficiency, minimizes redundancy, and restricts access to authorized users, such as system administrators. The system captures information about flights, airports, passengers, reservations, payments, and additional services offered on flights.
